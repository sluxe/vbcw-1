vbcw_news.1.d:0 "After an unsuspecting barrage of Artillery, the City of Truro has been taken by Royalist Forces. The Cornish Garrison seemed to have been caught off guard, as the City seemed empty when the Royalist Daimlers entered the city. As they neared the abandoned city centre, they noticed a Tram standing on the Road. Walking inside, they were caught unawares by a Lone Cornish Machinegunner inside, taking 15 Royalists out with him in a Blaze of Glory. At this signal, the Cornish Forces came out of their hiding places inside the Centre's many Pasty shops and begun firing back at the Advancing Royalists.In what can only be described as a horrific yet oddly delicious melee, the city ended up with many dead on both sides and bits of pasty everywhere, making life hell for the local cleaners. The Remainders of the Cornish forces have escaped to the Countryside"
