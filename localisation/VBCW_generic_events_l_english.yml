 vbcw.politics.1.d:0 "A Crisis has befallen the British Isles, and the Country stands at the brink of bloody ruin.\n\nIt began in the final weeks of 1936, when Prime Minister Baldwin, citing widespread opposition from Parliament, the public, and the Church, informed King Edward VIII that neither he nor his Cabinet could condone the King's marriage to American socialite and divorcee Wallis Simpson. Presenting the King with an ultimatum, Baldwin threated to resign his position unless the King renounced either his affection for Mrs Simpson, or the Crown.\n\nKing Edward, calling the Prime Minister's bluff, summoned Baldwin to the Palace and told him in no uncertain terms he would abandon neither the woman he loved, nor his birthright. True to his word, the Prime Minister immediately offered his resignation, swiftly followed by the rest of Cabinet. Attempts to come to an agreement with the remaining MPs came to nothing, effectively leaving the country without a Government.\n\nFinally, the King turned to his personal friend Oswald Mosley, invited him to the Palace, and exercised his Sovereign Authority to appoint Mosley the new Prime Minister."

 vbcw.politics.1.b:0 "Now's the time for action, not words."
 
 vbcw.politics.2.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.2.d:0 "The appointment of Mosley, already notorious for his extreme views, and not currently a Member of Parliament, caused widespread outrage. A staged walkout of MPs and Peers alike saw Parliament in Westminster reduced to little more than rump assembly of Monarchists and Mosleyites, while the absentee MPs and Peers set up a Parliament-in-Exile in York.\n\nMosley's appointment proved equally unpopular with the population at large, sparking protests across the country. Clashes between right-wing and socialist organisations, escalated into widespread violence over Christmas and the New Year, and many police forces struggled to keep the peace.\n\nViolence continued into the spring, amidst calls for the army to be called in to keep order. Unwilling to deploy troops against his own people, the King instead authorised the raising of Auxiliary Constabularies. Formed largely of pro-Mosley thugs, the Auxiliaries began to take a very heavy-handed approach and soon came to be seen not as keepers of the peace, but as enforcers of the King's personal rule, which only served to further galvanise his opponents.\n\nDespite this, it was announced that his Coronation in May would go ahead as planned."
 vbcw.politics.2.a:0 "Troubling times indeed. Do carry on."
 vbcw.politics.2.b:0 "Say no more. I know what needs to be done."
 
 vbcw.politics.3.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.3.d:0 "On the day of the Coronation, crowds lined the King's route from Buckingham Palace to Westerminster Abbey. Security was very tight, with the King travelling in a closed car, and escorted both by the Guards Regiments and by members of the Metropolitan Auxiliary Constabulary.\n\nHowever, as the Royal Procession entered Parliament Square, shots rang out, narrowly missing the King's car, which immediately sped off along Whitehall. Almost immediately, the Auxiliaries opened fire into the assembled crowd, believing the would-be assassin to be among them. In response, the Guards began firing on the Auxiliaries, with the ensuing exchange of fire lasting for fifteen minutes before senior officers managed to restrain their men.\n\nVisibly shaken as he took refuge at 10 Downing Street, Edward called on Mosley to immediately impose martial law on the capital, granting him a free hand to increase the powers of the Auxiliaries. The King then fled London that night to take up residence with Mrs Simpson at a Worcestershire country estate, where they were soon quietly married.\n\nThe following weeks saw widespread accusations and recriminations over the attempt on the King's life, culminating in the disbanding of the Guards regiments. The soldiers, once loyal servants of the Crown, were sent home, deeply resentful of having their honour so besmirched."
 vbcw.politics.3.a:0 "Good Lord, and then what?"
 vbcw.politics.3.b:0 "That's quite enough. To arms!"
 
 vbcw.politics.4.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.4.d:0 "As spring turned into summer, unrest continued to grow. The imposition of martial law further increased the resolve of the King's opponents, and many left-wing and anti-monarchist groups across Britain began to organise themselves into armed militias. Realising that even the Auxiliaries couldn't hope to maintain order in such a climate, the King finally agreed to deploy the Army, on the proviso that regiments would only serve in their home counties.\n\nAcross the Empire, meanwhile, the crisis had far-reaching consequences. The governments of Australia and New Zealand both fell as they struggled to maintain order, and the already fiercely nationalistic government of South Africa seized the opportunity to declare independence. In India, the Viceroy was only able to maintain order by force of arms, and British territories across the Middle East were beset by sporadic uprisings. Closer to home, Irish Taoiseach Eamon de Valera sent troops into Northern Ireland, ostensibly to help restore order, but ultimately to reclaim Ulster for the republic.\n\nOnly Canada remained unscathed, and offered refuge to the King's brothers and their families as they fled the increasingly hostile situation at home."
 vbcw.politics.4.a:0 "A dire situation. Could it get any worse?"
 vbcw.politics.4.b:0 "Have you quite finished?"
 
 vbcw.politics.5.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.5.d:0 "Summer soon gave way to autumn, but the tension at home and abroad showed no signs of abating. The leaders of the Anglican Church, driven by Archbishop Lang's opposition to the King's marriage, declared Edward unfit to serve as head of the Church of England, nor indeed as King. The newly formed Anglican League quickly became a focal point for public opposition to the King, attracting thousands of members. Inspired by this example, the Scottish Kirk followed suit and convened a Council of State. Declaring that Scotland would no longer recognise the rule of Edward or of the London government, the Council established the Scottish Republic, and closed the border with England.\n\nIn Wales, a similar wave of nationalist fervour bubbled to the surface, particularly in the rural north, where an independence movement was quickly established in the ancient capital of Machynlleth. Meanwhile, the industrial areas of south Wales, reflecting a pattern seen across the whole of Great Britain, saw the rapid growth of Workers' Militias, nucleating around local Trade Unions.\nIn York, the Parliament-in-Exile unanimously voted to appoint the King's brother, Prince Albert, as Lord Protector, and invited him to return from Canada to restore order. The United Kingdom was rapidly becoming anything but."

 vbcw.politics.6.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.6.d:0 "As winter began to draw in, sporadic violence continued across the country, and the various bands and militias began to crystallise into organised factions. Britain became an increasingly volatile powder keg, until one morning in November, when a tiny spark in Cornwall quickly turned into a conflagration which spread across the whole country.\n\nA Cornish nationalist group calling itself the Kernow Liberation Army had been making raids against Royalist forces and bases in Cornwall, and even crossed the border into Devon, entering into direct conflict with the Devonshire Regiment of the regular army. When the KLA retreated back across the Tamar, the Devonshires pursued, and found themselves under fire from the Duke of Cornwall's Regiment, who were already deployed along the river and believed the Devonshires to be an invading force. The two regiments entered into a pitched battle, and the Deveonshires eventually withdrew back across the border.\n\nHowever, the die was cast. As word spread, army regiments across the country realised they could no longer rely on direction from High Command, and would have to choose their own side."
 vbcw.politics.6.a:0 "Surely this means war?"
 vbcw.politics.6.b:0 "I bloody well hope so."
 
 vbcw.politics.7.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.7.d:0 "Now, town and country alike have been riven by open warfare, but no side has been able to make any serious territorial gains. With the worst of the winter weather fast approaching, a Christmas Truce has been called. Although uneasy, it has so far been honoured by all combatants. Much of the population is still hoping for an amicable solution, or at least, if there must be war, that the spirit of fair play will win out in the end.\n\nWhat say you?"
 vbcw.politics.7.a:0 "Honour the truce!"
 vbcw.politics.7.b:0 "Defy the truce!"
