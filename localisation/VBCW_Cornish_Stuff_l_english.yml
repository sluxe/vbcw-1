###EVENTS###
KER_events.1.t:0 "The Cornish Propose a Trade Deal"
KER_events.1.d:0 "A few days ago, a Cornish delegation with a very thick accent arrived in the city of Cork. After a very confusing dialogue in which both sides attempted to understand each other, it was finally decided that these strange men must be here as some sort of delegation. They were taken to the local mayor who finally managed to get to the bottom of the situation - these men are a trade delegation for Kernow. They were invited to speak with our own ministers, and over a nice cup of tea decided that - "
KER_events.1.a:0 "The Cornish are nice chaps - yes, let us agree"
KER_events.1.b:0 "If we can Hardly understand them, how on Earth are we meant to trade?"
KER_events.2.t:0 "The Irish agree to the Deal"
KER_events.2.d:0 "Our delegation returned to Truro today. They told us of their voyage across the sea, their near-death encounter with a Royalist motorboat armed with a four-pounder cannon and how they finally reached Cork. After a large deal of inconvenience, they were finally given the time to talk to the Irish economic ministers. During a meeting that quickly devolved into small talk, it was decided that our two countries will, in fact, tighten trade relations. The immediate transportation of their coal and aluminium will commence and in return we will invest in some of their local industries."
KER_events.2.a:0 "How nice of them"
KER_events.3.t:0 "The Irish refused our Deal"
KER_events.3.d:0 "Our Delegation came back with a truly terrifying tale to tell! After a dangerous crossing to Cork, where their ship was boarded by a Royalist motorboat armed with a four-Pounder cannon, they had reached Cork. After a very rude conversation with the locals which included phrases such as 'these bloody Cornish' and 'God's sake speak English' the delegation was finally arranged to meet the Irish minister. After a very long and again, rude, conversation however, the negotiations broke down after one the Irish ministers said that 'We can't even understand you, how are we meant to trade?'. Our delegates may have been speaking unclearly yet that was no reason for the Irish to be so rude! We don't need their Stinking coal anyways...."

KER_events.4.t:0 "An Expedition to Norway"
KER_events.4.d:0 "The Norwegians have rare metals that could be of use to us for development and manufacture of advanced weapons. Though the seas are dangerous, we should attempt a daring expedition of our finest trade experts to the Norwegians. The expedition is ready to depart with a very large supply of tea and pasties for the way. "
KER_events.4.a:0 "Let us see how our Brave men fare."
KER_events.5.t:0 "Norwegians accept Deal"
KER_events.5.d:0 "Our experts returned earlier today, having completed their mission. Upon reaching Norway they were treated like honoured guests, even being granted an Audience with the King. The King was elated to hear of our intentions, and has agreed to begin the shipment of rare metals to our nation in exchange for our help with beurocratic matters. The first shipment of these metals has arrived with our envoys."
KER_events.5.a:0 "Jolly good"
KER_events.6.t:0 "The Norwegians refuse our Deal"
KER_events.6.d:0 "Having travelled many, many miles, our emissaries have returned from the snowy hills and icy seas of Norway. Facing many hardships on the way, we have faced off against enemy trawlers, avoided mines, faced harsh storms. Having reached the Norwegian Coast, we were not met by fanfares or even a nice welcome. Viewing us as renegades, we were welcomed as common brigands and ordered to turn our ship back around to where we came from. Seeing this as nothing more than a practical joke, we tried to start some sort of talk with the Norwegians. This ended poorly, as we were chased off by the local Gendarmes and were almost shot at by the coastal battery. They barely made it back alive."
KER_events.6.a:0 "They can keep their mangy fish for all we care"
KER_events.7.t:0 "Emissaries Sunk"
KER_events.7.d:0 "Early today, one of our trawlers returned from their patrol around the coast when they came upon a horrible sight. Our emissaries, aboard a clearly labelled diplomatic ship, were attacked by a Royalist submarine off the coast Portsmouth. The submarine gave our ship no warning, claiming that they believed the vessel to be a Q-Ship, an invention from the Great War. All aboard the ships were sunk, but our trawler was able to at least retrieve some of the tea we were to offer to the Norwegian King."

Bishop Hunkin has sent out invitations to the pair, to meet at his Parish house in Truro for a good old fashioned cup of tea."
KER_events.9.a:0 "Bertha! Could you turn the kettle on dear?"
KER_events.10.t:0 "Pre-Party Preperations"
KER_events.10.d:0 "With the invitations sent out, a very large issue has become apparent - what should the Bishop wear?\n\n Whilst the Archbishop of Cantenbury would find it quite iffy to not wear vestments in the Parish house, the King might feel uncomfortable between two men of the cloth. Whilst one of the generals call for a good-old fashioned suit, the local parishoners are planning to call for a petition that Bishop Hunkin wears his Vestments to Tea."
KER_events.10.a:0 "Reginald, can you get the Vestments please!"
KER_events.10.b:0 "Jenny! Pass me the suit dear."
KER_events.11.t:0 "Pre-Party Preperations"
KER_events.11.d:0 "With the dress-code sorted, the forecast for the next few days is to be quite chilly. It has become apparent that the Archbishop will want to walk around Hunkin's famed gardens, and the need for a hat is very much the case. Again, this is a very important issue - shall the Bishop wear a Tophat or a Bowler hat?"
KER_events.11.a:0 "Time to brush the dust off the Tophat"
KER_events.11.b:0 "Blimey, I've not worn that Bowler Hat in forever"
KER_events.12.t:0 "Archbishop Cosmo Lang arrives"
KER_events.12.d:0 "Pulling up in his stylish Rolls-Royce with flags of the Anglican League proudly waving by its headlights. Stepping out the car in his vestments, he quickly came up to Bishop Hunkin, shaking his hand. What followed was very typical for Cosmo - a whole pantry arrived, with members of the Women's Institute and their followers taking the city by storm with their Sandwiches and tea. With the Archbishop now, all that is missing is King Edward himself to arrive."
KER_events.12.a:0 "Morning Archbishop! Quite chilly today, don't you think?"
KER_events.13.t:0 "King Edward VIII Arrives"
KER_events.13.d:0 "As lunchtime begun to loom, and the bishops began to get peckish, King Edward finally arrived. Driving into town on his beautiful 1937 Jaguar SS - luckily without Wallis by his side. Seeming to have a case of the cold, the king was holding a tissue the whole time, blowing his nose non-schalantly every now and again. After the formalities have been concluded, the trio of Hunkin, Cosmo and Edward finally entered the Parish House, impatient to eat lunch."
KER_events.13.a:0 "Just this way gentlemen."
KER_events.14.t:0 "Shall I be mother?"
KER_events.14.d:0 "As the trio made them selves comfortable - Cosmo Lang sitting down on the large sofa, King Edward taking his position on the Armchair and Hunkin on an antique chair, the hardest question of the evening has arisen - who shall be mother?"
KER_events.14.a:0 "The host should always pour"
KER_events.14.b:0 "Archbishop, you may have the honours"
KER_events.15.t:0 "How many sugars?"
KER_events.15.d:0 "With the formalities of the pouring completed, Bishop Hunkin was faced with another, terryfing dilemma. Whilst the Archbishop is known for his sweet tooth, the King has never made his preference public. With the two staring impatiently at the Bishop, holding the sugar bowl in his hand, a tough choice must be made."

KER_events.16.d:0 "With the business of the Tea Drinking complete, there is still one thing left to do. The Bishop is known far and wide in Cornwall for his wonderful and well-cultivated gardens. After a whole afternoon of 'oohs' , 'ahs' and 'that one looks like a dog pissed on it', the time for the two guests to leave. On the way out, the Bishop gave them :"
