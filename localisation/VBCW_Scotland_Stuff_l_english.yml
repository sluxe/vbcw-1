However, he favours Scotland becoming a dominion of England rather than full independence. \n Another very strong candidate is Andrew Dewar Gibb, who favours the status quo and continuing MacEwan’s legacy. \n A young outsider is Robert Mcintyre, a more left wing choice that favours more radical change and rapprochement with the People’s Armies. \n Who wins the vote?
